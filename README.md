# SIGDAT official website

This is the code for the official website for the ACL SIGDAT: the Association for Computational Linguistics Special Interest Group for linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to natural language processing.  

It's currently using the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/).

You can test this website locally on macOS as follows:

1. Install bundler: `sudo gem install bundler`. Make sure you have Ruby and Bundler versions > 2.4.
2. Check out this repository.
3. Run the gems needed by this repository: `sudo bundle install`. 
   *Note*: This step might fail when installing the `nokogiri` gem. If this happens, run `bundle config build.nokogiri --use-system-libraries` and then run `bundle install` again.
4. Start the jekyll server by running `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
5. You can then see the website at http://localhost:4000.
